# Super Javascript
> Javascript with superpowers

## What is it?
> It's a Javascript engine; currently just an interpreter but there are more features to come, including:
* compile to C
* compile to 32bit assembly
* compile to 64bit assembly
* bundle for web
* JSX support
* Typescript support

## Building it
### Build dependencies
> To build `sjs` you will need:
* cmake
* gcc
### Build instructions
> After you've made sure you've got all the dependencies listed above, you can run:
``` bash
mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```
> You will now have a binary that can run Javascript.

## TODO
- [ ] compile to C
- [ ] compile to 32bit assembly
- [ ] compile to 64bit assembly
- [ ] bundle for web
- [ ] JSX support
- [ ] Typescript support
